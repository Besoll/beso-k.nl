      question: "How long does it take to deliver a website?",
      answer:
        "We aim to deliver a fully functional custom website in as little as 7 days. The exact timeline depends on the complexity and scope of your project. For simpler websites with up to 5 pages, the process can be quick, especially when all necessary content and images are provided promptly. For larger, more complex projects, or if you're adding custom features like additional languages, integrations, or a photo shoot, it might take a bit longer. However, we prioritize both speed and quality, ensuring that you have a fully optimized, responsive, and SEO-friendly site delivered in record time without compromising on performance or design.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is included in the WordPress website package?",
      answer:
        "The WordPress package is an all-inclusive offer designed to give you a professionally built website with everything you need to launch quickly. You’ll get up to 5 custom-designed pages with SEO optimization, fully responsive across all devices. It also includes essential legal pages, a custom form for inquiries or leads, and an easy-to-use admin panel for content updates. Additionally, we provide licensed stock images under your name, ensuring you have high-quality visuals. The package also covers domain registration, hosting, and 5 business email addresses, giving you a complete online presence.",

      question: "What is WaaS (Website as a Service)?",
      answer:
        "WaaS, or Website as a Service, means we manage your website entirely for you, so you don’t have to worry about technicalities. Unlike traditional models where clients are handed a dashboard to manage content (which can lead to errors or outdated information), WaaS allows you to simply send us requests via WhatsApp or email, and we handle the updates and changes instantly. Whether it's updating services, adding new content, or optimizing your site for better performance, our team takes care of everything. You can focus on growing your business while we ensure your website stays fresh, fast, and secure with regular updates, security enhancements, and the latest technology.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the hourly rates for updates?",
      answer:
        "For ongoing updates after the initial setup, we offer hourly rates based on your package, but they’re not mandatory. After the included 3-month free administration, rates are €49/hour for WordPress websites, €64/hour for Shopify webshops, and €119/hour for custom Next.js websites. This pay-as-you-go model gives you the flexibility to request updates whenever you need.",

    {
      question: "Can I customize my website beyond the basic package?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! Each package provides a solid foundation, but we understand that every business has unique needs. You can customize your website with additional pages, languages, and unique features. For example, we offer a personalized photo shoot for €500, which includes professional photography, editing, and content creation. If you need more custom features, such as advanced forms, third-party integrations, or specific functionalities, we can discuss these options to create a tailored solution that fits your business perfectly. The goal is to build a website that not only meets but exceeds your expectations.",
